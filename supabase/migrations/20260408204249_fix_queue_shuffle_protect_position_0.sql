-- =============================================================================
-- Fix queue_shuffle: NEVER touch position 0
--
-- Problem: With the delete-based queue system, queue_shuffle's method of
-- finding the "currently playing" item via player_status.current_media_id JOIN
-- no longer works reliably (the current item is deleted immediately when
-- queue_next runs).
--
-- Fix: Position 0 is SACRED - queue_shuffle will NEVER touch it.
--   - Only shuffle items at position >= 1
--   - Position 0 is excluded entirely from the shuffle
--   - This ensures the next-up item stays at position 0
