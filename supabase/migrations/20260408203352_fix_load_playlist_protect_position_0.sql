-- =============================================================================
-- Fix load_playlist: NEVER overwrite queue position 0
--
-- Problem: When loading a playlist, position 0 (the now_playing/next item)
-- was being overwritten if the currently-playing detection failed or if the
-- player had just started.
--
-- Fix: Position 0 is now SACRED - load_playlist will NEVER touch it.
--   - Delete only positions 1+ (not position 0)
--   - Insert new items starting at position 1 (not position 0)
--   - Position 0 continues playing naturally, then the new playlist follows
